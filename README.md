Polish Computation Instructions

1. Create a file with the expressions you want to calculate line-by-line

2. Compile PolishComputation.java with the console command: javac PolishComputation.java

3. Run the console command: java PolishComputation Computations.txt, replacing Computations.txt with your file

4. View the outputted results of your computations line-by-line in the console

I have included the project file PolishComputation.java and a Computations.txt file for my personal testing.
